Kerala floods: Troops rush in to help rescue efforts

Hundreds of troops, and dozens of boats and helicopters are helping to evacuate people from what officials say is the worst flooding there in a century.

Many people are still believed to be trapped on rooftops of flooded homes.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier flew over the worst-hit sites and met state officials to discuss the crisis.

There are fears the situation may get worse with more heavy rain and strong winds forecast over the weekend.
